            <h1>Frustrated</h1>
            <p>
              In this state you may find yourself feeling exasperated because your sense of 
              progress is less that you hoped for or expected. There might be specific things you 
              want to achieve or a change you would like to bring into the workplace or into your 
              work product; however, the pace of progress is likely unsatisfying for you on some level.  As a result, you might find it challenging to find things to celebrate. This state
              indicates that you see your work as highly meaningful and because of this it may 
              also be true that you feel some pressure to make things happen. This caring can lead to high levels of activity (trying to do too much) that could become stressful over time. In some instances it might even cause you to obsess.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often, a facet of obsessing is a tendency to allow failures at work to play on one's 
              mind. This may be because failures are seen as a missed opportunity to create 
              forward movement, which may cause further frustration because you care so much.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this state, your work offers some fulfillment but because passion is also fueled by 
              progress, the lack of forward movement you sometimes experience can become an 
              energy drain. Without a high sense of progress, work may not be quite as much fun,
              perhaps making it difficult, at times, to stay inspired.  When this happens work may 
              feel too much like work, especially when everything seems to be a high priority. During these times, you may feel so busy that you don't seem to have time to think.
              The upside is that time does pass fairly quick.

            <h1>Unfulfilled</h1>
            <p>
              In this state you may find your work doesn't provide you with the sense of 
              fulfillment you desire. This situation may sometimes cause you to lack energy both 
              at work and outside of work. Your work does hold some meaning for you but you are
              not able to see the progress you desire. As a result, experiencing a sense of 
              fulfillment, consistently at work, is perhaps difficult. The domino effect of this could 
              be that you tend not to celebrate, which may further prevent you from experiencing
              a reliable sense of accomplishment, thereby progress.
            </p>
            <p>You likely have deep aspirations and ambitions that you yearn to achieve and it 
              may appear that your current work experience is not supporting movement in this 
              direction, hence your pace of progress may feel too slow. You may even puzzle over
              others' enthusiasm. On some days, you may find yourself considering other work 
              but you also worry about the financial impact of change
              It could also be that you sometimes doubt whether your current work will provide 
              opportunities to fulfill these aspirations or help you achieve your potential. These 
              doubts, over time, may effect your self-esteem or self-confidence if you don't 
              manage this situation to your benefit

            <p>
              In this state, you likely find your work somewhat challenging and somewhat 
              fulfilling. Your score indicates that your sense of meaning and progress are typical, 
              meaning they fall in the average zone (neither high nor low). You get your work 
              done and take things in stride; in other words, you tend not to get too worked up 
              about things. You celebrate some of your accomplishments however may miss 
              opportunities to celebrate other achievements, as you may deem them less 
              significant and so less worthy of celebration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your score indicates that you see your work as somewhat meaningful and you are 
              seeing some progress. This is the most common profile in our database. 
              Statistically, it is deemed "the average." In other words, people in this state may 
              enjoy their work but there may be room to deepen one's connection to meaning and
              to increase the opportunities to make progress visible
              A common characteristic of this state is not getting too fussed about mistakes. You 
              pretty much go with the flow.

            <p>
              Time goes neither too slowly nor does it fly. You 
              appear to have enough work to keep you occupied and productive without 
              becoming too busy or overwhelmed.  This state indicates that in many ways you are
              comfortable with your work. In this state, it is likely that your work neither 
              aggravates you nor really jazzes you.
              You have enough meaning and progress to engage in at least some facets of your 
              work. In other words, you have enough to buffer you from the negative areas but 
              you might need a boost to move you into the states of Energized, Engaged, or 
              Passionately Engaged

              In this state you may experience a good measure of fulfillment at work and you likely take time to celebrate your accomplishments. You are apt to have some resilience and are probably not driven crazy or frustrated by most matters. Therefore, you tend not to obsess; however, work is likely very important to you and contributes significantly to your sense of identity. Your scores indicate that your engagement is driven more by a sense of high progress, as your meaning scores 
              are somewhat lower. Nevertheless, you do see a good amount of meaning in your work. Your scores indicate you have a sense of purpose and feel emotionally connected to your work.

              Your scores indicate a very healthy sense of progress.  For the most part, you appear to see the impact of your actions and, as a result, feel a sense of forward movement. This sense of progress likely energizes you. In fact, in this state of work, progress is a distinguishing driver of engagement.
              When your sense of progress is strongest, you are apt to celebrate your achievements.

              that you are also learning and growing. As a result, you may find it easy to focus on 
              your work and you may identify strongly with it. At times, you might feel as if you care more than others, as your work likely means more to you than a paycheck.

              In this state you may find your work fairly unchallenging or not as fulfilling as you 
              would like. This could result, at times, in feeling disengaged from your work. As a 
              result, time may drag and you might find yourself living for your interests outside ofwork. You might also struggle to find reasons to celebrate as your work may not 
              give you the sense of accomplishment you desire. The sense of meaning and 
              progress at work you crave may feel low compared to what you have previously 
              known. You may notice on some days, or perhaps even many days, you find  yourself yearning for more.
            </p>
            <p>
              It could be that your aspirations and long-term goals may be unclear to you or you 
              do not see how they can be achieved within your current work and career situation, 
              which will likely reduce the meaning you see in your work. This has left you feeling somewhat at a standstill.
            </p>
            <p class="text-black">
              This may be compounded by the fact that your work is not challenging enough for 
              you. In fact, it might be too easy for you.  You desire to use fully your talents and to also continue to learn and grow.  You may find that your sense of progress at work 
              is held back without this stimulation. It may also mean that you worry about having 
              the opportunity in your current work to achieve your potential. This situation, when prevalent for longer periods of time, may begin to impact your self-esteem or self-confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              All in all, this work experience may leave you feeling a lack of momentum, as you 
              are not actively working toward personally meaningful goals at work; however, your
              heart's desire is likely much deeper engagement

            <h1>Disconnected</h1>
            <p>
              In this state you reported experiencing a strong sense of progress. This functions as
              a strength for you. You also reported that your overall meaning is significantly lower than your sense of progress. This situation may lead to a work experience in which you get your work done but you may not get a great deal of joy from it. Nonetheless, you have ownership for your work and you do move your tasks/objectives forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              This profile usually indicates that you are responsible at work in that you meet your obligations. You likely have a sense of ownership for your work and how your work 
              is accomplished. It is also possible that you are able to make at least some decisions about how your work gets done. People with this profile generally have the skills to do their work; in fact, you may feel you have untapped potential.
            </p>
            <p>However, it is also often true that with this profile you do not have a strong connection to purpose, which may also be lowering you sense of meaning. In addition, you might feel that your work often goes unappreciated by others, especially outside of your immediate team. Sometimes, you (your position/work) may feel taken for-granted or under-valued. For example, you may not feel fully included in the flow of communications and you may not see how to offer your input.  It is possible that this may lead to a sense of being separate from the heartbeat of the organization or possibly over-focusing on your own area.</p>
            <p>
              Although a focus on your own work may give you a sense of healthy progress, you 
              may not know exactly how the progress you achieve connects to the organization's mission. This may lead to a tendency to neglect celebration.
